Choosing an Emergency Loan

Finding a service provider for a fast personal emergency loan requires some research on your part to ensure that you’re getting the best deal. You’ll want to think about all of the key loan terms and evaluate the lender. Start by comparing these factors.
Turnaround Time

If you need money quickly, pay special attention to how long the lender says it typically takes to get approved and receive funding. Some can take as long as several business days, while others can close in a day or two.
Interest Rate

Emergency loans can have a wide interest rate range and your credit score will directly influence the rate you qualify for.
