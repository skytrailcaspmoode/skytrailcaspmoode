Age: Most loans require you to be at least 18 years of age. 
Citizenship: Some lenders work only with U.S. citizens, so be mindful of that requirement if that’s not your status.
Income/employment: Expect to show proof that you are currently working, as well as what your earnings are. The lender wants to make sure you have the means to make your payments.
Minimum credit score: Requirements will vary by lender, but generally, having a score that’s considered “good,” which is 670 or above, means you should have no problem qualifying. Some lenders will work with borrowers with scores as low as 580, though interest rates will be higher.
